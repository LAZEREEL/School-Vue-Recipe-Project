# School-Vue-Recipe-Project

This is a front-end School Group project in VUE mostly focused on the back-end. 

We were given the back-end API from our Teacher and built the front-end.

Requirements were:
-Start
*Startpage with a list of all the recipes in the DB.
*Every recipe shown need to show all releveant information, such as: Name of recipe, small picture, rating, how many ingridients, est. time to make recipe.
*The startpage also need a category component, every category should show how many recipes from that category are in the DB.
*Clicking on a category should route you to the releveant categorypage.
*Clicking a recipe takes you to the said recipe with all the info corresponding to that recipe.
*The startpage should also have a Search bar that filters the main list of recipes.

-Category
*The categorypage has the same desgin as the startpage but only lists the  recepis of the chosen cateogry.
*In the category list the chosen category should be marked with bold.

-Recipe
*The recipepage should show Name, Description, Rating, # of ingridients, time to make, picture, list of all ingridients, a section for instructions, a rating component (When you click on a rating (1-5 stars) your vote need to be sent right away, after its been sent you should get a "Thanks for you rating" response) and finally a commentsection.

-Comments
*The user should be able to post a comment with Comment, Name and a send prompt. If all fields arent filled in correctly clear validation messages should pop up and nothing should be sent to the db.
*While the comment is being sent the field should be disabled so you cant double send.
*When the comment has been successfully been sent you should get a "Thanks for your comment" message.
*Comments that have been posted should be displayed in a list and every comment needs to show: Name, comment and date/time when the comment was sent in
